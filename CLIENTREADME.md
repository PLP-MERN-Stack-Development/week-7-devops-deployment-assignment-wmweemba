- No external dependencies or email verification required

```typescript
// Example login flow
const login = async (username: string, password: string) => {
  // Check if user exists in localStorage
  // If not, create new user automatically
  // Generate session token and store user data
};
```

### 2. Borrower Management

  email?: string;
  joiningDate: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive';
  totalLoans: number;
  totalOutstanding: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface Loan {
  id: string;

- **Efficient State Management**: Optimized Context usage

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Testing Approach

**Manual Testing Areas:**
- User authentication flows
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Calculation accuracy for loans and payments
- Report generation and export functionality
- PWA installation and offline capabilities
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Recommended Testing:**
```bash
# Unit tests for business logic
npm test

# E2E testing with Playwright/Cypress
npm run test:e2e

# Performance testing
npm run test:performance
```

## üîÑ Data Migration and Backup

### Export/Import Functionality

**Data Export:**
```javascript
// Exports all application data as JSON
const exportData = () => {
  return {
    borrowers: getAllBorrowers(),
    loans: getAllLoans(),
    payments: getAllPayments(),
    accountBalance: getAccountBalance(),
    exportDate: new Date().toISOString()
  };
};
```

**Data Import:**
```javascript
// Imports data from JSON backup
const importData = (jsonData) => {
  // Validates and imports all data types
  // Maintains data integrity and relationships
};
```

### Backup Strategy

1. **Regular Exports**: Users should export data regularly
2. **Browser Backup**: Data persists in localStorage
3. **Cross-Device Transfer**: Export from one device, import to another
4. **Version Control**: JSON format allows version tracking

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Data Not Persisting:**
- Check browser localStorage quota
- Verify localStorage is enabled
- Clear browser cache if corrupted

**Performance Issues:**
- Large datasets may slow down the app
- Consider data archiving for old records
- Use browser dev tools to identify bottlenecks

**PWA Installation Issues:**
- Ensure HTTPS connection
- Check service worker registration
- Verify manifest.json configuration

### Debug Mode

```javascript
// Enable debug logging
localStorage.setItem('fortitude_debug', 'true');

// View all stored data
console.log('All Data:', storageService.exportData());
```
